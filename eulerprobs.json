Without any further rules we would expect to visit each square with equal probability: 2.5%. However, landing on G2J (Go To Jail), CC (community chest), and CH (chance) changes this distribution.\nIn addition to G2J, and one card from each of CC and CH, that orders the player to go directly to jail, if a player rolls three consecutive doubles, they do not advance the result of their 3rd roll. Instead they proceed directly to jail.\nAt the beginning of the game, the CC and CH cards are shuffled. When a player lands on CC or CH they take a card from the top of the respective pile and, after following the instructions, it is returned to the bottom of the pile. There are sixteen cards in each pile, but for the purpose of this problem we are only concerned with cards that order a movement; any instruction not concerned with movement will be ignored and the player will remain on the CC/CH square.\nCommunity Chest (2/16 cards):\nAdvance to GO\nGo to JAIL\n\nChance (10/16 cards):\nAdvance to GO\nGo to JAIL\nGo to C1\nGo to E3\nGo to H2\nGo to R1\nGo to next R (railway company)\nGo to next R\nGo to next U (utility company)\nGo back 3 squares.\n\nThe heart of this problem concerns the likelihood of visiting a particular square. That is, the probability of finishing at that square after a roll.

For example, you could enter room 1 using your first card, place one card in the storage box, and use your third card to exit the room back to the start. Then after collecting three more cards from the dispensing machine you could use one to enter room 1 and collect the card you placed in the box a moment ago.

E.g.\nIf n=3, the best we can do is obviously to ask the number \"2\". The answer will immediately lead us to find the hidden number (at a total cost = 2).\nIf n=8, we might decide to use a \"binary search\" type of strategy: Our first question would be \"4\" and if the hidden number is higher than 4 we will need one or two additional questions.\nLet our second question be \"6\". If the hidden number is still higher than 6, we will need a third question in order to discriminate between 7 and 8.\nThus, our third question will be \"7\" and the total cost for this worst-case scenario will be 4+6+7=17.\nWe can improve considerably the worst-case cost for n=8, by asking \"5\" as our first question.\nIf we are told that the hidden number is higher than 5, our second question will be \"7\", then we'll know for certain what the hidden number is (for a total cost of 5+7=12).\nIf we are told that the hidden number is lower than 5, our second question will be \"3\" and if the hidden number is lower than 3 our third question will be \"1\", giving a total cost of 5+3+1=9.\nSince 12&gt;9, the worst-case cost for this strategy is 12. That's better than what we achieved previously with the \"binary search\" strategy; it is also better than or equal to any other strategy.\nSo, in fact, we have just described an optimal strategy for n=8.\nLet C(n) be the worst-case cost achieved by an optimal strategy for n, as described above.\nThus C(1) = 0, C(2) = 1, C(3) = 2 and C(8) = 12.\nSimilarly, C(100) = 400 and C(n) = 17575.\nFind C(n).\n",

Then,\nIf the result is negative, all the sheep in that group are deemed to be virus-free.\nIf the result is positive, 5 additional tests will be performed (a separate test for each animal) to determine the affected individual(s).\n\nSince the probability of infection for any specific animal is only 0.02, the first test (on the pooled samples) for each group will be:\nNegative (and no more tests needed) with probability 0.985 = 0.9039207968.\nPositive (5 additional tests needed) with probability 1 - 0.9039207968 = 0.0960792032.\n\nThus, the expected number of tests for each group is 1 + 0.0960792032 \u00d7 5 = 1.480396016.\nConsequently, all 5 groups can be screened using an average of only 1.480396016 \u00d7 5 = 7.40198008 tests, which represents a huge saving of more than 70% !\n\n\nAlthough the scheme we have just described seems to be very efficient, it can still be improved considerably (always assuming that the test is sufficiently sensitive and that there are no adverse effects caused by mixing different samples). E.g.:\nWe may start by running a test on a mixture of all the 25 samples. It can be verified that in about 60.35% of the cases this test will be negative, thus no more tests will be needed. Further testing will only be required for the remaining 39.65% of the cases.\nIf we know that at least one animal in a group of 5 is infected and the first 4 individual tests come out negative, there is no need to run a test on the fifth animal (we know that it must be infected).\nWe can try a different number of groups / different number of animals in each group, adjusting those numbers at each level so that the total expected number of tests will be minimised.\n\nTo simplify the very wide range of possibilities, there is one restriction we place when devising the most cost-efficient testing scheme: whenever we start with a mixed sample, all the sheep contributing to that sample must be fully screened (i.e. a verdict of infected / virus-free must be reached for all of them) before we start examining any other animals.\n\nFor the current example, it turns out that the most cost-efficient testing scheme (we'll call it the optimal strategy) requires an average of just 4.155452 tests!\n\n\n\nUsing the optimal strategy, let T(s,p) represent the average number of tests needed to screen a flock of s sheep for a virus having probability p to be present in any individual.\nThus, rounded to six decimal places, T(25, 0.02) = 4.155452 and T(25, 0.10) = 12.702124.\n\n\nFind \u03a3T(10000, p) for p=0.01, 0.02, 0.03, ... 0.50.\nGive your answer rounded to six decimal places.\n\n",

  "431": "\nFred the farmer arranges to have a new storage silo installed on his farm and having an obsession for all things square he is absolutely devastated when he discovers that it is circular. Quentin, the representative from the company that installed the silo, explains that they only manufacture cylindrical silos, but he points out that it is resting on a square base. Fred is not amused and insists that it is removed from his property.\nQuick thinking Quentin explains that when granular materials are delivered from above a conical slope is formed and the natural angle made with the horizontal is called the angle of repose. For example if the angle of repose, $\\alpha = 30$ degrees, and grain is delivered at the centre of the silo then a perfect cone will form towards the top of the cylinder. In the case of this silo, which has a diameter of 6m, the amount of space wasted would be approximately 32.648388556 m3. However, if grain is delivered at a point on the top which has a horizontal distance of $x$ metres from the centre then a cone with a strangely curved and sloping base is formed. He shows Fred a picture.\n\n\nWe shall let the amount of space wasted in cubic metres be given by $V(x)$. If $x = 1.114785284$, which happens to have three squared decimal places, then the amount of space wasted, $V(1.114785284) \\approx 36$. Given the range of possible solutions to this problem there is exactly one other option: $V(2.511167869) \\approx 49$. It would be like knowing that the square is king of the silo, sitting in splendid glory on top of your grain.\nFred's eyes light up with delight at this elegant resolution, but on closer inspection of Quentin's drawings and calculations his happiness turns to despondency once more. Fred points out to Quentin that it's the radius of the silo that is 6 metres, not the diameter, and the angle of repose for his grain is 40 degrees. However, if Quentin can find a set of solutions for this particular silo then he will be more than happy to keep it.\nIf Quick thinking Quentin is to satisfy frustratingly fussy Fred the farmer's appetite for all things square then determine the values of $x$ for all possible square space wastage options and calculate $\\sum x$ correct to 9 decimal places.\n",

For example, a mixture described by the ratio (2\u00a0:\u00a03\u00a0:\u00a05) contains 20% A, 30% B and 50% C.\nFor the purposes of this problem, we cannot separate the individual components from a mixture. However, we can combine different amounts of different mixtures to form mixtures with new ratios.\nFor example, say we have three mixtures with ratios (3\u00a0:\u00a00\u00a0:\u00a02), (3\u00a0:\u00a06\u00a0:\u00a011) and (3\u00a0:\u00a03\u00a0:\u00a04).

Suppose that for every triple of integers (a, b, c) with 0 \u2264 a, b, c \u2264 n and gcd(a, b, c) = 1, we have a mixture with ratio (a\u00a0:\u00a0b\u00a0:\u00a0c).

  "522": "\nDespite the popularity of Hilbert's infinite hotel, Hilbert decided to try managing extremely large finite hotels, instead.\nTo cut costs, Hilbert wished to power the new hotel with his own special generator. Each floor would send power to the floor above it, with the top floor sending power back down to the bottom floor. That way, Hilbert could have the generator placed on any given floor (as he likes having the option) and have electricity flow freely throughout the entire hotel.\nUnfortunately, the contractors misinterpreted the schematics when they built the hotel. They informed Hilbert that each floor sends power to another floor at random, instead. This may compromise Hilbert's freedom to have the generator placed anywhere, since blackouts could occur on certain floors.\nFor example, consider a sample flow diagram for a three-story hotel:\n\nIf the generator were placed on the first floor, then every floor would receive power. But if it were placed on the second or third floors instead, then there would be a blackout on the first floor. Note that while a given floor can receive power from many other floors at once, it can only send power to one other floor.\nTo resolve the blackout concerns, Hilbert decided to have a minimal number of floors rewired. To rewire a floor is to change the floor it sends power to. In the sample diagram above, all possible blackouts can be avoided by rewiring the second floor to send power to the first floor instead of the third floor.\nLet F(n) be the sum of the minimum number of floor rewirings needed over all possible power-flow arrangements in a hotel of n floors.

  "563": "\nA company specialises in producing large rectangular metal sheets, starting from unit square metal plates.  The welding is performed by a range of robots of increasing size.  Unfortunately, the programming options of these robots are rather limited.  Each one can only process up to 25 identical rectangles of metal, which they can weld along either edge to produce a larger rectangle.  The only programmable variables are the number of rectangles to be processed (up to and including 25), and whether to weld the long or short edge.\nFor example, the first robot could be programmed to weld together 11 raw unit square plates to make a 11\u00d71 strip.  The next could take 10 of these 11\u00d71 strips, and weld them either to make a longer 110\u00d71 strip, or a 11\u00d710 rectangle.  Many, but not all, possible dimensions of  metal sheets can be constructed in this way.\nOne regular customer has a particularly unusual order.  He always demands that the finished product should have an exact area, and that the long side must not be more than 10% larger than the short side.  If these requirements can be met in more than one way, in terms of the exact dimensions of the two sides, then he demands that all variants are produced.  For example, if he were to ask for metal sheet of area 889200, then there are three final dimensions that can be produced: 900\u00d7988, 912\u00d7975 and 936\u00d7950.  The target area of 889200 is the smallest area which can be manufactured in three different variants, within the limitations of the robot welders.\nLet M(n) be the minimal area that can be manufactured in exactly n variants with the longer edge not greater than 10% bigger than the shorter edge.  Hence M(3) = 889200.\nFind $ \\sum_{n=2}^{100} M(n)$.\n",

After waiting several hours and receiving no response it is decided to send a team to investigate, of which you are included. Upon entering the vessel you are met by a friendly holographic figure, Katharina, who explains the purpose of the vessel, Eulertopia.\nShe claims that Eulertopia is almost older than time itself. Its mission was to take advantage of a combination of incredible computational power and vast periods of time to discover the answer to life, the universe, and everything. Hence the resident cleaning robot, Leonhard, along with his housekeeping responsibilities, was built with a powerful computational matrix to ponder the meaning of life as he wanders through a massive 1000 by 1000 square grid of rooms. She goes on to explain that the rooms are numbered sequentially from left to right, row by row. So, for example, if Leonhard was wandering around a 5 by 5 grid then the rooms would be numbered in the following way.\n\n\nMany millenia ago Leonhard reported to Katharina to have found the answer and he is willing to share it with any life form who proves to be worthy of such knowledge.\nKatharina further explains that the designers of Leonhard were given instructions to program him with equal probability of remaining in the same room or travelling to an adjacent room. However, it was not clear to them if this meant (i) an equal probability being split equally between remaining in the room and the number of available routes, or, (ii) an equal probability (50%) of remaining in the same room and then the other 50% was to be split equally between the number of available routes.\n\n\n\n(i) Probability of remaining related to number of exits\n(ii) Fixed 50% probability of remaining\n\nThe records indicate that they decided to flip a coin. Heads would mean that the probability of remaining was dynamically related to the number of exits whereas tails would mean that they program Leonhard with a fixed 50% probability of remaining in a particular room. Unfortunately there is no record of the outcome of the coin, so without further information we would need to assume that there is equal probability of either of the choices being implemented.\nKatharina suggests it should not be too challenging to determine that the probability of finding him in a square numbered room in a 5 by 5 grid after unfathomable periods of time would be approximately 0.177976190476 [12 d.p.].\nIn order to prove yourself worthy of visiting the great oracle you must calculate the probability of finding him in a square numbered room in the 1000 by 1000 lair in which he has been wandering.\n(Give your answer rounded to 12 decimal places)\n",

On examining the drone, they uncovered a device that sought the answer for the so called \"Birthday Problem\". The description of the problem was as follows:\nIf people on your planet were to enter a very large room one by one, what will be the expected number of people in the room when you first find 3 people with Birthdays within 1 day from each other.\nThe description further instructed them to enter the answer into the device and send the drone into space again. Startled by this turn of events, the Wimwians consulted their best mathematicians. Each year on Wimwi has 10 days and the mathematicians assumed equally likely birthdays and ignored leap years (leap years in Wimwi have 11 days), and found 5.78688636 to be the required answer. As such, the Wimwians entered this answer and sent the drone back into space.\nAfter traveling light years away, the drone then landed on planet Joka. The same events ensued except this time, the numbers in the device had changed due to some unknown technical issues.

They too entered the answer into the device and launched the drone into space again.\nThis time the drone landed on planet Earth. As before the numbers in the problem description had changed. It read:\nIf people on your planet were to enter a very large room one by one, what will be the expected number of people in the room when you first find 4 people with Birthdays within 7 days from each other.\nWhat would be the answer (rounded to eight places after the decimal point) the people of Earth have to enter into the device for a year with 365 days?

  "589": "\n\nChristopher Robin and Pooh Bear love the game of Poohsticks so much that they invented a new version which allows them to play for longer before one of them wins and they have to go home for tea. The game starts as normal with both dropping a stick simultaneously on the upstream side of a bridge. But rather than the game ending when one of the sticks emerges on the downstream side, instead they fish their sticks out of the water, and drop them back in again on the upstream side. The game only ends when one of the sticks emerges from under the bridge ahead of the other one having also 'lapped' the other stick - that is, having made one additional journey under the bridge compared to the other stick.\n\n\nOn a particular day when playing this game, the time taken for a stick to travel under the bridge varies between a minimum of 30 seconds, and a maximum of 60 seconds. The time taken to fish a stick out of the water and drop it back in again on the other side is 5 seconds. The current under the bridge has the unusual property that the sticks' journey time is always an integral number of seconds, and it is equally likely to emerge at any of the possible times between 30 and 60 seconds (inclusive). It turns out that under these circumstances, the expected time for playing a single game is 1036.15 seconds (rounded to 2 decimal places). This time is measured from the point of dropping the sticks for the first time, to the point where the winning stick emerges from under the bridge having lapped the other.\n\n\nThe stream flows at different rates each day, but maintains the property that the journey time in seconds is equally distributed amongst the integers from a minimum, $n$, to a maximum, $m$, inclusive.

(Because of the staggered starting positions, higher-placed boats row a slightly shorter course than lower-placed boats.)\n\nWhen a \"bump\" occurs, the \"bumping\" boat takes no further part in the race. The \"bumped\" boat must continue, however, and may even be \"bumped\" again by boats that started two or more places behind it.\n\nAfter the race, boats are assigned new places within the division, based on the bumps that occurred.

For example, $M_3(1) = 588$ and $M_6(2) = 486864$.\nFind the last $8$ digits of $M_{10^8+7}(10^4+7)$.\n",

  "607": "\n\nFrodo and Sam need to travel 100 leagues due East from point A to point B. On normal terrain, they can cover 10 leagues per day, and so the journey would take 10 days. However, their path is crossed by a long marsh which runs exactly South-West to North-East, and walking through the marsh will slow them down. The marsh is 50 leagues wide at all points, and the mid-point of AB is located in the middle of the marsh. A map of the region is shown in the diagram below:\n\n\n\n\nThe marsh consists of 5 distinct regions, each 10 leagues across, as shown by the shading in the map. The strip closest to point A is relatively light marsh, and can be crossed at a speed of 9 leagues per day. However, each strip becomes progressively harder to navigate, the speeds going down to 8, 7, 6 and finally 5 leagues per day for the final region of marsh, before it ends and the terrain becomes easier again, with the speed going back to 10 leagues per day.\n\n\nIf Frodo and Sam were to head directly East for point B, they would travel exactly 100 leagues, and the journey would take approximately 13.4738 days. However, this time can be shortened if they deviate from the direct path.\n\n\nFind the shortest possible time required to travel from point A to B, and give your answer in days, rounded to 10 decimal places.\n\n"
